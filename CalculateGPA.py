# Semester GPA Calculation
# Purpose: This program will calculate a student’s semester grade
# by using the students previous credits/GPA and then asking the student
# for their letter grades and the matching credit hours for that grade.
# The program will print out the students semester GPA followed by a
# cumulative GPA

# User Defined Functions
#####################################
# Function Name: getGrades
#
# Purpose: To get all of the semester grades the user would like to use in 
# the calculation. We will handle prompting the user for the letter grade
# and the credit hours, for as many classes as they want. We will do error
# handling to make sure it is a correct letter grade. We are going to store
# the grades and credit hours in a list of sublists.
#
# Parameters or Arguments: none
#
# Return: The value returned is a list of sublists, in which each sublists
# contains the letter grade for a given course and the associated number of
# credits, for example [[‘A’,3], [‘B’,4],[‘A’,3],[‘C’,3]
